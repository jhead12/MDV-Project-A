	# The contestant name var contestant ="John"; had been cooking his first meal in the contest for
cooking time var cookTime = 20; and he still had to put in the second food item. He only cooked some
foodItems = [ "chicken" , "vegetables", "potatoes", "desert"].

 Is time to var cookDish = function(meal){...};? It looks like I have var mealsLeft = meals.length; to
go. The Judges say that there are 30 Mins left, and if the competition (mealsLeft > 0) ends.

 As the "John" looks at the clock the time is wining down var timeLeft = 0; timeNumber < time.length;
timeNumber--), There we there was a missing item that was needed missingItem = function(call,
words){...}. the result came out to be that: return "there are none of the items that you are looking
for!"
